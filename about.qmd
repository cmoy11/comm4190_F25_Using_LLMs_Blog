Hi! I'm Cameron Moy! I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania Annenberg School for Communication. I study digital platforms through the frameworks of critical data studies, algorithmic & design justice, and racial & platform capitalism. My mixed methods work interrogates platformized racial hierarchies and power structures to imagine and realize a more just and equitable digital future at the intersection of Communication and Human-Computer Interaction research.
