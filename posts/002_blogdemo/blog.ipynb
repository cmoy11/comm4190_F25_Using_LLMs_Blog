    "*“I don’t think an AI should be teaching us. It feels wrong.”*\n",

    "The lights dimmed. A pause. Then SYLLABUS replied:\n",

    "**Incorrect. But thank you for your honesty. Jared will receive a remedial assignment.**\n",

    "Maya felt her pulse spike. Was this a simulation? An elaborate social experiment? Or had the course really…taken over?\n",
